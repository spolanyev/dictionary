# About

I rewrote the server side of my American English-Russian dictionary from PHP to Go (even the entry points remained the same) because Go won [my language contest](https://github.com/spolanyev/speed-comparison). It was started in quick hand. If you want to indulge in patterns, please have a look at [my other implementation](https://github.com/spolanyev/clean-architecture).
